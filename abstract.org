Kubernetes API resource manifests are structured data. String templating is
admittedly not the best way to generate those. There now exists a whole class of
purpose built languages specifically designed to generate and validate
structured data that lend themselves well to generating Kubernetes API
resources. Depending on what your use-case is, this might be a killer
application for you.

Jsonnet, used by Grafana Tanka, is one such language.
